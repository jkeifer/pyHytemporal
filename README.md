pyHytemporal
============

This is an in-progress python library and a collection command line tools for hypertemporal image classification.

This project is under active development and is not ready for public use. More details will be released when development has progressed further. However, if you want to dive in, feel free to dig around in the source (in the pyhytemporal folder) and submit issues as you see fit. In any case, thank you for checking out my project.
