pyHytemporal
============

This is an in-progress python library and command line tools for hypertemporal image classification.

This library is under active development and is not ready for public use. More details will be released when development has progressed further. However, if you want to dive in, feel free to dig around in the source and submit issues as you see fit. In any case, thank you for checking out my project.
